# Engineer-salary-statistical-analysis
In this project, I:
<br>
<li>Perform exploratory data analysis: histogram, boxplot to check the difference and make some comparison between different engineer salaries of different regions and professions. </li>
<li>Plotted interaction plot to consider the interaction between 2 features in terms of target variable – ‘salary’.</li>
<li>Conducted ANOVA analysis to confirm the interaction by interpreting p-value.</li>
<li>Conducted TukeyHSD to see more statistical details on Resudual, Fitted, Scale-Location and Normal Q-Q plots.</li>
<li>Finally, performed the Shapiro test to check if residuals were normaly distributed.</li>
